        <h2>Excellence in Atmospheric Science</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                IITM stands at the forefront of atmospheric science research in India, serving as a <strong>center of excellence in monsoon meteorology</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its research spans <strong>climate science</strong>, <strong>observational meteorology</strong> of clouds and precipitation, and <strong>laboratory-based studies</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The institute is home to <strong>150 scientists</strong> and over <strong>50 support staff</strong>, all dedicated to advancing knowledge in <strong>monsoon dynamics</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The foundation of IITM’s research on <strong>clouds and precipitation</strong> dates back to its early years under the leadership of <strong>Prof. Pisharoty</strong>, who sought to unravel the mysteries of monsoon clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1970s, Director <strong>Prof. Sikka</strong> further expanded this work, leading investigations into <strong>cloud seeding</strong> prospects in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the monsoon’s variability across space and time, IITM's core focus is to enhance the understanding of <strong>monsoon fluctuations</strong> and improve the <strong>predictability of weather and climate patterns</strong>.
